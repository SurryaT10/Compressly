<h1>Compressly: Optimize Your Image Colors and Size</h1>
Compressly is a tool designed to reduce the size of your images by compressing their color palettes using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. This project focuses on optimizing images, reducing the number of unique colors while maintaining visual quality, making it ideal for image compression and storage.

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Color Palette Reduction: Compress the image by clustering similar colors and reducing the number of unique colors used.</li>
  <li>Image Size Optimization: Shrinks the file size of images, making them lightweight and efficient for web use.</li>
  <li>Preserved Quality: Retains the visual essence of the image while reducing its complexity.</li>
  <li>Real-Time Processing: Accepts user-submitted images and dynamically applies K-Means clustering to optimize colors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Use Compressly?</h3>
<h5>Compressly is perfect for:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Web Developers: Optimize images for faster loading times and reduced bandwidth.</li>
  <li>Graphic Designers: Simplify color schemes for stylized, posterized effects.</li>
  <li>Data Storage: Save storage space while preserving image integrity.</li>
  <li>Compression Tools: Enhance existing PNG optimization workflows by reducing color complexity.</li>
</ul>
